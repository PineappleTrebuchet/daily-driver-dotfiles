# Daily Dotfiles
My daily driver dotfiles. These are mainly for private use and they aren't very aesthetically pleasing, but the repo is public if you really want to use these for some reason.
For more aesthetically pleasing dotfiles, check out my old ones [here](https://github.com/PineappleTrebuchet/everforest-dotfiles).

### Why did you switch away from everforest if it looks better?
Two reasons:
- If I use even a single application that doesn't fall in line with the theme, it honestly gets annoying.
- I felt that in terms of a daily driver, I should focus mainly on functionality more than aesthetic.

## Features
- Qogir GTK theme + icons
- Configured waybar, sway config, etc.
